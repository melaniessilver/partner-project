# Amazing Name-Birthday Messenger

# What the Software Does

Our program is an amazing program that takes multiple inputs from the user to give them a personalized message.  At first, it asks what their name is and that is followed by a question asking when their birthday is.  The result is a spectacular message that greets the user, while mentioning their name, and says when their birthday is. 

This program is extremely helpful so that a user can tell someone their birthday by running through our program and then showing someone near them the output.  Also useful if someone is to forget their birthday they can go back and see the inputs that he or she entered in.

Our program is as simple as 3 lines:
```python
name = input("enter a name")
birthday = input("enter a birthday")
print("Hello " + name + ". Your birthday is " + birthday)
```
